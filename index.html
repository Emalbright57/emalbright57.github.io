    <p style="font-size:150%">Hello! My name is Em Albright<br></p>
      <p style="font-size:110%">I use any pronouns!<br>
      I'm a genderfluid student at CU Boulder studying creative technology and design.
      I am a costume maker/designer that likes to work on all parts of a costume:props, outfits, wig, makeup, etc.
      I am also goth and really into fashion and music!<br>
      My goal for this class is to learn how to create and design web pages with hands on experience</p>
