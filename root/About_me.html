        <h1>Hello! My name is Em Albright<h1>
        <p>I'm a genderfluid student at CU Boulder studying creative technology and design.
          I am a costume maker/designer that likes to work on all parts of a costume:props, outfits, wig, makeup, etc.
          I am also goth and really into fashion and music!<br>
          My goal for this class is to learn how to create and design web pages with hands on experience</p>
