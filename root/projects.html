    <p>Millie costume</p>
    <p>This is my most recent project/costume.  The entire costume took me about 40-60 hours to make.  The axe itself took about 30-40 and is seven and a half feet tall.  The axe is made from eva foam and pvc pipe.  The tail is eva foam dowels covered in wire.  The horns and fake buttons were made from eva foam.
      This picture was taken and edited by myself.  </p>
