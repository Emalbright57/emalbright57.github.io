  <h1>Millie</h1>
  <p>Millie is a red, female imp. This is my most recent project/costume.  The entire costume took me about 40-60 hours to make.  The axe itself took about 30-40 and is seven and a half feet tall.  The axe is made from eva foam and pvc pipe.  The tail is eva foam dowels covered in wire.  The horns and fake buttons were made from eva foam.
     This picture was taken and edited by myself.</p>
  <h1>Azazel</h1>
   <p>Azazel is a white haired demon. This was the biggest costume I have ever done. The costume took approximately 150 hours to make. The costume is 100% made by me.</p>
  <h1>Spring Fairy</h1>
  <p>The spring fairy is an original costume designed entirely by myself.  As one of my smaller costumes, this project only took about 25 hours to make.  The headpiece is made with fake floral and the horns are made with wire and paper mache.  The wings are made with cellaphone, wire and cardstock.  The top is a corset I bought and styled with fake vines and floral.  The skirt is a simple circle skirt made with multiple layers of fabric. </p>
  <h1>Paige</h1>
  <p>Paige is a cursed notebook taken human form. This costume took about 40 hours total to make. The dress was made with a modified pattern I found online wiith felt decalts. The crown is made with paper flowers I created and colored pencils. This was the first costume that was made entirely by myself</p>
